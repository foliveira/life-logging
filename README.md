## Life-Logging

This project was aimed at developing a simple and unobtrusive life logger.

### Purpose
The Life-Logging project started in the 2011/12 [PVIM](https://fenix.ist.utl.pt/disciplinas/gvip36/?locale=en_EN) course at [IST](http://www.ist.utl.pt/); it is very simple to use and above all really unobtrusive, since the user can control when to execute it.

### Installation
Compile it with a .NET compiler, pray to a random Entity that Google still supports the GoogleDocs integration we used and run the application.

### Usage
Just press the correct keys in your keyboard and the life-logger window will popup on your screen. By correct keys we mean Ctrl+Alt+L

### Testing
I'm sure we'll be creating some test suite to go on with this. Just kidding, it was a quick, dirty project.
