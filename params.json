{"name":"Life-Logging","tagline":"Log, Visualize, Share - Life-Logging","body":"## Life-Logging\r\n\r\nThis project was aimed at developing a simple and unobtrusive life logger.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nThe Life-Logging project started in the 2011/12 [PVIM](https://fenix.ist.utl.pt/disciplinas/gvip36/?locale=en_EN) course at [IST](http://www.ist.utl.pt/); it is very simple to use and above all really unobtrusive, since the user can control when to execute it.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nCompile it with a .NET compiler, pray to a random Entity that Google still supports the GoogleDocs integration we used and run the application.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nJust press the correct keys in your keyboard and the life-logger window will popup on your screen. By correct keys we mean Ctrl+Alt+L\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI'm sure we'll be creating some test suite to go on with this. Just kidding, it was a quick, dirty project.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nFeel free to contact us: Fábio Oliveira (@foliveira) and João Dias (@macacao).\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Fábio Oliveira and João Dias\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Modified BSD License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause","google":"UA-30569297-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
